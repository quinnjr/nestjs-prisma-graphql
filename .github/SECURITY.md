## Security Best Practices

When using this generator:

1. **Keep dependencies updated**

   ```bash
   pnpm update
   ```

2. **Review generated code**
   - The generator creates code from your schema
   - Always review generated types for sensitive fields

3. **Use @HideField()**

   ```prisma
   model User {
     /// @HideField()
     password String
   }
   ```

4. **Validate inputs**
   - Enable class-validator in production
   - Use strict validation rules
